# maria-tech-brigade-effort
This repository is a place to place ideas and communication records in an effort to keep everything open and accesible.

# Why is this in English?

Simple, in the tech community English is a unifying language. It permits us to include people from around the world that want to help in the hurricane Maria tech relief effort.

# How to contribute ideas

We are using [Github issues](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) to track ideas that come from the community and people on the ground.

We are defining people on the ground as:

* First responders
* Agency chiefs, workers that are working with disaster relief
* Disaster relief workers from private sector that are in Puerto Rico

We are defining community as:

* Well you frankly.

# How are these ideas going to be worked on

Resources will be deployed on a volunteer basis to work on the ideas that people on the ground identify as pain points or of urgent need.

That does not mean that anybody can work on what ever they want. What we are trying to do is to be effective with our resources and be effective in our help to people back home.
